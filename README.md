Hi,

I'm Maxime, a French engineering student at ISAE-ENSMA, specializing in data, simulation, and uncertainty quantification.

🔬 I’m passionate about building mathematical models and running simulations to better understand complex systems.

📉 From physical processes to financial dynamics, I enjoy working where uncertainty meets engineering.

🧠 I’m currently sharpening my skills in C++ and Python through personal projects in Monte Carlo methods, physics, and numerical optimization.

🧪 I recently completed a research internship on quantum control theory, applying GRAPE algorithms to simulate and optimize qubit dynamics.

🌐 I’m open to technical collaborations, or international internships for 2026.
